## Game Overview
The work is from GGJ2023 and the theme is "root".
We had so many ideas and wanted to make a 3D game that it turned out we couldn't finish the project.
Due to the time constraints of the project, it's not really finished yet, but it's a demo that can be experienced.

## Design Concept

A capybara that can't control its farting, bouncing around the map.

## Game Mechanics

Pufferfish as the protagonist: Players control the pufferfish, which can roll and bounce in unique ways, providing a dynamic and humorous gameplay experience.
Unique Movement Mechanics: The movement of the dolphin is influenced by physics-based mechanics, focusing on non-traditional methods such as rolling and bouncing.
Interactive environments: Players can interact with a variety of in-game elements such as crocodiles, pelicans and different types of terrain such as bushes and through-trees.
Oranges as collectibles: consuming oranges increases the energy of the pufferfish and affects its movement.

## Game Highlights

Uncontrollable movement of the capybara and some deliberately reserved hilarious bugs.

## Game controls:

Move: ← & →

Jump: Space

Interaction: E

Eat: C
